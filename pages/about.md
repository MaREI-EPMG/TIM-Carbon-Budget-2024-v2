### CARBON BUDGET ANALYSIS WITH THE TIMES-IRELAND MODEL

##### Third iteration of modelling to support CCAC CBWG<br><br>
##### SCENARIO ASSUMPTIONS
Five different Carbon Budgets (CB) for the period 2021-2050 are modelled based on the IPCC assessment of the global Remaining Carbon Budget (RCB). The analysis focuses on the RCBs aligned with 1.5°C to 2°C of global warming with different probabilities. These CBs for Ireland are as follows:

* 450Mt aligned with 67% likelihood of limiting global warming to 2.0°C (IPCC AR6 1150Gt CO<sub>2</sub> RCB)

* 400Mt aligned with 1.7°C (33%) (IPCC AR6 1050Gt CO<sub>2</sub> RCB)

* 350Mt aligned with 1.5°C (17%) and 2.0°C (83%) (IPCC AR6 900Gt CO<sub>2</sub> RCB)

* 300Mt aligned with 1.7°C (50%) (IPCC AR6 850Gt CO<sub>2</sub> RCB)

* 250Mt aligned with 1.5°C (33%) and 1.7°C (67%) (IPCC AR6 650-700Gt CO<sub>2</sub> RCB)

Carbon budget allocations are as follows:

##### CORE SCENARIOS
The carbon budget scenarios include CB1 and CB2, which are implemented for the periods 2021 to 2025 and 2026 to 2030, respectively. These scenarios have an overall carbon budget of 250Mt to 450Mt applied from 2021 to 2050. All five CB scenarios are modeled using a business-as-usual (BAU) demand projection and do not have a suffix, such as "*Mitigation 250 mt*".

##### OTHER SCENARIOS

* **Low Energy Demand (LED)**: Four of the lower CBs are modelled using a LED projection. They have LED suffixes such as "*Mitigation 250 mt-LED*". 

* **WAM** and **WEM**: Emissions projections from the EPA are used as the lower bound for emissions in the 2024-2030 period, instead of CB1 and CB2. However, the overall CBs remain set for the 2021-2050 period, using BaU energy demand projections such as "*Mitigation 250 mt-wam*" and "*Mitigation 250 mt-wem*"

* **High solar**: This scenario group considers higher solar PV adoption within the core scenarios, such as "*Mitigation 250 mt-high solar*"

* **No bio**: This scenario group restricts biomass imports to current levels and no increase allowed beyond the existing import levels, such as "*Mitigation 250 mt-nobio*"

* **Myopic**: This experimental scenario group represents situations where the model lacks complete information about techno-economic developments in the energy system, such as future cost changes, energy efficiency improvements, or the availability of new technologies. Instead of projecting over the entire time horizon, the model operates in shorter time steps. In the current setup, the model runs for carbon budget scenarios using 15-year time steps, with a 5-year overlap between each step. It is indicated in scenario names, such as "*Mitigation 250 mt-myopic 15-year step*"
