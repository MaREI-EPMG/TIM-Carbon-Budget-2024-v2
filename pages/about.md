#### CARBON BUDGET ANALYSIS WITH THE TIMES-IRELAND MODEL (TIM)

##### Third iteration of modelling to support CCAC CBWG<br><br>
##### SCENARIO ASSUMPTIONS
Five different Carbon Budgets (CB) for the period 2021-2050 are modelled based on the IPCC assessment of the global Remaining Carbon Budget (RCB). The analysis focuses on the RCBs aligned with 1.5°C to 2°C of global warming with different probabilities. These CBs for Ireland are as follows:

* 450Mt aligned with 67% likelihood of limiting global warming to 2.0°C (IPCC AR6 1150Gt CO<sub>2</sub> RCB)

* 400Mt aligned with 1.7°C (33%) (IPCC AR6 1050Gt CO<sub>2</sub> RCB)

* 350Mt aligned with 1.5°C (17%) and 2.0°C (83%) (IPCC AR6 900Gt CO<sub>2</sub> RCB)

* 300Mt aligned with 1.7°C (50%) (IPCC AR6 850Gt CO<sub>2</sub> RCB)

* 250Mt aligned with 1.5°C (33%) and 1.7°C (67%) (IPCC AR6 650-700Gt CO<sub>2</sub> RCB)

The TIM scenarios incorporate two types of carbon budget constraints for different periods:

**(1) CB 2021-2030**: This budget represents the maximum allowable CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from energy systems for the period 2021 to 2030. In core scenarios, this constraint is based on Sectoral Emissions Ceilings (SECs) as outlined in the [Table 3.2 Climate Action Plan](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/296414/7a06bae1-4c1c-4cdc-ac36-978e3119362e.pdf#page=null). The total SECs for the periods 2021-2025 and 2026-2030 have a maximum limit of 275 Mt of CO<sub>2</sub> and is fixed across all scenarios.

**(2) CB 2021-2050**: This is the overall carbon budget constraint that sets the maximum allowable CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from energy systems for the period 2021 to 2050. The specified amount reflects the limits in scenario names. For example, the *350Mt* scenario assumes a maximum of 350 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from energy systems from 2021 to 2050.

The figure below shows the CB allocations for various scenarios. In the 250Mt scenario, the CB allocated for 2021-2030 is greater than the total budget for the entire period from 2021 to 2050. This reflects the model's ability to offset excess emissions after 2030 by using negative emissions technologies, such as Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). Additionally, to analyse the With Existing Measures (WEM) and With Additional Measures (WAM) scenarios, two other emissions levels for the period from 2021 to 2030 are considered, with carbon budgets of 310 Mt and 325 Mt, respectively.

#### CORE SCENARIOS
These scenarios have an overall carbon budget of 250Mt to 450Mt applied from 2021 to 2050. All five CB scenarios are modeled using a business-as-usual (BAU) demand projection and do not have a suffix, such as "*250Mt*". Moreover, a maximum allowable carbon budget of 275 million tonnes for the period from 2021 to 2030 is also considered in the core scenarios.

* **Low Energy Demand (LED)**: Four of the lower CBs are modelled using a LED projection. They have LED suffixes such as "*250Mt-LED*". For the detailed assumptions of LED scenarios see [Article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667095X22000083).

* **WAM** & **WEM**: Emissions projections from the EPA are used as the lower bound for emissions in the pre-2030 period. However, the overall CBs remain set for the 2021-2050 period, using BaU energy demand projections. For example, "*350Mt-WEM*" indicates an overall carbon budget of 350 million tonnes for 2021 to 2050 and 310 million tonnes for 2021 to 2030.

* **LowBio**: This scenario group restricts biomass imports to current levels and no increase is allowed beyond the existing import levels, such as "*250Mt-LowBio*"
